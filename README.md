This is a work example for Truss. 

The code was written in PHP for reading the CSV data and outputting another CSV file, with normalized data. 
The file is hosted on my company's website and can be executed by navigating to this link in your browser window:

The replacement of unicode characters is begun, but not complete - I hope that a review of the code will give a general idea on how it can continue to be improved. If you would like the code presented in another language and/or format, please don't hesitate to ask.
